        Hello, my name is Jonah Douglas and I am excited you\'re here! I am a Junior Android
        Application Developer and I built GeoStereo as a fun way to establish my portfolio. This
        application was built using Android\'s language Kotlin with the help of their Jetpack
        components library and some APIs from Google, Weather, and Spotify.\n\n
        A quick outline of an Use Case:\n
        1. Open the GeoStereo Application.\n
        2. Allow location permissions to the application while it is open. **No data collection here**\n
        3. Press the \'Find Nearest Location\' button and let the app take over!\n
        4. Enjoy a randomly selected song from Spotify that corresponds to the closest location data
        near you. (If no near locations, then weather will do!)\n\n
        I hope you thoroughly enjoy my app and please reach out to me via email at
        jonah.douglas23@gmail.com if you have any features or issues you\'d like to let me know about!\n\n
        Best,\n
        Jonah Douglas
